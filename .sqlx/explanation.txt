run this to generate the queries:

cargo sqlx prepare --workspace -- --all-targets

prepare performs the same work that is usually done when cargo build is invoked but it
saves the outcome of those queries into a directory (.sqlx) which can later be detected by sqlx itself and
used to skip the queries altogether and perform an offline build.
